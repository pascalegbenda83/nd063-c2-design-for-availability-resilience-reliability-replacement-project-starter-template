
On the basis of a selected config of: 100 gb db, backup every 24 hours, response time 15 minutes; The Recovery time objective (RTO) or recovery point objective (RPO) numbers are as follows:

1) Min RTO for single AZ outage is approximately 45 minutes (response time of support 15 minutes + backup retention period 30 minutes )

2) Min RTO for single region outage is approximtely 1 hour (response time of support 15 minutes + backup retention and promotion of replica is 45 minutes )

3) Min RPO for single AZ outage - several minutes(failover to readreplica)

4) Min RPO or single region outage - 24 hours (as backup is on a daily basis ie.every 24 hours)


These estimates are based on unavailablity of an hour service time.

Also, the bandwidth in a single Availability Zone (AZ) is higher than in multiple AZ. This affects the recovery time and the assumed bandwidth difference may double.
